    "## Introduction\n",
    "Based on an analysis of trial results from 2019 and 2020 conducted across three districts (Chwele, Bungoma, and Lugari), this study aimed to inform whether company X should scale the prepayment fee to 10% for all farmers or maintain the existing fee structure. Statistical comparisons were made between repayment rates in both years to identify trends, followed by feature selection to uncover key drivers of repayment behaviour. A multivariate model was then developed to understand the relationships between features and repayment correlations. Ultimately, these analyses inform the recommendation regarding the prepayment fee structure."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "#### 1)Descriptive Statistics in the trial districts Chwele, Bungoma, Lugari for the years 2019 and 2020:\n",
    "I initiated the analysis by conducting descriptive statistics for the trial districts across all features. The objective was to promptly identify any discernible patterns, particularly focusing on factors influencing repayment and the overall performance of repayment within the respective districts.\""

    "Based on the t-test results for both trial and non-trial districts:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trial Districts:\n",
    "- For all features, including the number of enrolled farmers, qualified clients, farmers who repaid, farmers who defaulted, revenue, and amount defaulted, there are no statistically significant differences between 2019 and 2020.\n",
    "- This suggests that the performance metrics remained relatively stable over the two years within the trial districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Trial Districts:\n",
    "- While there were no significant differences in the number of enrolled farmers and qualified clients between 2019 and 2020, the number of farmers who defaulted and the amount defaulted showed statistically significant differences.\n",
    "- This indicates a notable increase in defaults and defaulted amounts in non-trial districts from 2019 to 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations:\n",
    "1. Further investigate the factors contributing to the increase in defaults and defaulted amounts in non-trial districts.\n",
    "2. Conduct a deeper analysis to understand the stability of performance metrics over time in trial districts and explore potential strategies for improvement if necessary.\n",
    "3. Consider expanding the analysis to include additional years or incorporating other relevant variables to gain a more comprehensive understanding of district performance.\n",
    "4. Implement targeted interventions based on the findings to address any identified challenges and enhance overall performance in both trial and non-trial districts.\n"
